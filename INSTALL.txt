Installation of the liveticker

For update instructions see UPDATE.txt

Database:
create a new database or use an existing one and run the contents of sql/create.sql
against it. You may want to create a separate user to access this table. This
user needs select, update, delete and insert rights.

Application:
-create a new folder called liveticker (or whatever you like it to be) in your 
 htdocs folder.
-copy the contents of this folder with all subfolders and files to the new 
 destination.
-change access permissions to the folder tickerdata to be world writeable
 (e.g. chmod -R a+w /home/www/liveticker/tickerdata)
-edit the file config.php to match your environment
-have fun.

Tested environment:
this application has been written on an Apple computer.
The software versions this liveticker works on are:
Apache Webserver 2
PHP 5.1.6
MySQL 5.0.19
Versions above shouldn't be a problem.

PROBLEMS?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 99.9% of the cases if the output of the ticker doesn't work after installation
the error is that the FRAGMENTDIR and OUTPUTDIR constants defined in config.php 
don't contain the correct ABSOLUTE path to the folders. The easiest way to find out
what the absolute path to the liveticker folder is is to create a small php script
with the following content:

<?php
    echo dirname( __FILE__ );
?>

This script, when called in the browser, displays the full path to itself which
should be easily adaptable to your needs.
