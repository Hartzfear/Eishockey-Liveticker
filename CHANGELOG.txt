2010/09/26 - v 1.4.2

   working flawlessly when the refs box was showing.
   
2010/09/21 - v 1.4.1
 - fixed a bug in admin/index.php

   being looked on mobile devices.

   (http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards)

   readability

2009/02/24 - v 1.3.1
 - fixed a bug when creating a new game
 - fixed an issue with 10 minutes MISC penalties
 - updated the UPDATE.txt

2009/02/18 - v 1.3
 - general
   - converted all source files to use tabs (4) instead of spaces
   - due to a bug (thanks to Franz for pointing it out) a connection to the database
     was always created even if it wasn't required. This led to problems on heavily
     frequented livetickers or tickers running on low performance servers. The 
     DBLayer class has been rewritten to initialize itself only if needed (when query()
     is called) and has a finalizer which is called in every script after the last use.
 - admin
   - prevented a goal or penalty entry from being stored when no team is selected.
   - added the following fields to the match edit screen
     - number of spectators
     - referee lineup (up to two head and two linesman)
     - length of the overtime
 - display
   - the complete output mechanism has been rewritten in an Object Oriented way. Only
     part left is the caching mechanism. All the rest has been rewritten.
   - switched the template engine to smarty (http://www.smarty.net) for far better 
     functionality in the templates
   - now knowing about the "penaltyschieÃŸen" situation thanks to a patch supplied
     by Rene Peck
   - added the Austrian Nationalliga logo in a transparent PNG format (thanks to Roland)
   - changed the default output style to match the current style of the 100 Pro Dornbirn
     Liveticker
 
2009/01/23 - v 1.2.3
 - the ticker now also knows about the time between the periods and displays 
   different text in the pauses, after the game, etc.

2008/09/26 - v 1.2.2
 - changed the behaviour of calling the index page if there are no active matches.
   In this case the newest inactive match is chosen.

2008/09/21 - v 1.2.1
 - there was still a bug with the first player of the guest team being displayed
   concatenated to the last player of the home team. Must be a difference between
   versions as I'm sure I tested it. Nevertheless it's fixed now.

2008/08/30 - v 1.2
 - calling index.php now redirects to the oldest running ticker automatically
   thus making it possible to have a always working link to the current match
   in navigations, on pages, where ever.
 - it's possible to set a match as being currently running and therefore 
   updating automatically. By default this setting is set to true.
   -> replace <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"> with @{meta_refresh}
 - the match list shows which games are currently running
 - the time at which an entry in the liveticker has been created is now displayed
   in the output. This timestamp is NOT modified if the entry is modified!
   -> add @{entry_time} at the desired location
 - fixed a bug where the last player of the home team was always concatenated with
   the first player of the guest team if there was no trailing newline in the 
   players list.
   
v 1.1
 - statistics
 - ability to add links which are automatically linked
 - ability to add links to the player lists
