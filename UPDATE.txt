Updating from a previous version of the liveticker is really easy.

Make a backup of everything. You never know what might happen.

To update from version 1.1 to 1.2
---------------------------------

Run the sql/update_1.1_1.2.sql script on your database and it will create
two new fields leaving the data unchanged.

Copy the new php files over the existing ones in both the root and the admin
folder. Take care not to overwrite your config.php file!

Copy over or update your templates in fragments/ according:
- to disable the automatic reload if the ticker is not enabled:
  -> copy fragments/meta_refresh.html from the archive to your fragments/ folder
  -> replace <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"> with @{meta_refresh} in all
     body*.html files
- to display the timestamp of the entry:
  -> add the @{entry_time} placeholder in the info.html, goal.html and penalty.html
     fragments at the desired location. 
     
To update from version 1.2.x to 1.3
-----------------------------------

ATTENTION: 
----------
  I haven't tested this script in PHP 4. I don't know if the OO design 
  choices I made are compatible with it!
  
Run the sql/update_1.2_1.3.sql script on your database and it will create
a couple of new fields in the liveticker_match table. The data will be unchanged

- Copy the new php files over the existing ones.
- Copy the match folder to your liveticker folder. It contains the Classes required
  for the new liveticker to work.
- Copy the templates folder to your liveticker folder (it will be used instead of 
  the fragments folder)
- In your tickerdata folders create two new folders 'templates_c' and 'cache' and 
  make them world writable. (chmod a+w templatec_c; chmod a+w cache)
- Create the required styles in your ./styles.css file. The new styles are:
  .referee, .referee h3, .referee h4, .referee head, .referee linesman, div.spectators
  The other styles are named the same way and should apply without problems to the
  elements specified in the smarty templates
- Update the FRAGMENTDIR setting in your config.php to point to the templates folder
  instead of the fragments folder.


To update from version 1.3 to version 1.4
-----------------------------------------
- make a backup of your config.php. 
- Copy the new php files over the existing ones.
- if your clock is running backwards starting this season add the following to
  your config.php:
  define( 'CLOCK_RUNNING_DIRECTION', 'desc' );
- You may delete the index_old.php file and fragments folder.
- Copy the templates/admin folder to your installation's template folder
